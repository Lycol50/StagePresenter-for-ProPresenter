A better Stage Display for ProPresenter 7.
An electron application that connects to ProPresenter 7 and
displays Presentations, Playlists, Slide-Previews, Timers, Countdowns and Stage-Messages.

StagePresenter can be used on the same computer, where ProPresenter is running.
But it can also be installed on a different computer on the same network.

## Download

Download on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stagepresenter/id1566729423)

## Try it in the Browser

Visit [https://stagepresenter.com](https://stagepresenter.com/) to try directly in the browser (Chrome is recommended).

## Screenshots

All of the display will be used to show song lyrics.<br>
StagePresenter shows more than the current and next slide.<br>
If possible the complete verse, chorus or bridge is on the screen, since they get repeated quite often.
